# Dark Mode Light Back — Safari Extension

This simple Safari extension adds a default white background color.

Many websites don't specify a background color, and rely on the browser to default to white. 
Dark Mode Safari's default background color is dark gray, so dark text becomes unreadable.

## Installation

1. Download or clone this repo.
2. Enable Safari's Developer Tools — https://developer.apple.com/safari/tools/
3. Open menu: Develop > Show Extension Builder.
4. Click the [+] button in the lower left of the Extension Builder, and choose "Add Extension."
5. Navigate to where you cloned or downloaded this repo, and select the "Dark Mode Light Background.safariextension" folder. 
(You should see the extension loaded in the Extension Builder.)
6. Click "Run" in the upper-right corner. It may ask for your admin password to install.


## Privacy

This thing doesn't collect any data, or actually have any logic in it whatsoever. So there's no privacy concerns. The "Website Access" it requests is just so it's allowed to inject a background color in to the page.
